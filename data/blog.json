    "details": "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a 'preflight' request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request.",
